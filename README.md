# Fork of Sweep

**Note: I haven't yet received a manufactured PCB so I cannot recommend this yet, but I will update when I have.**

This is a fork of [Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) with the following modifications to the Half-Swept board:

- Removed all the silkscreen text (so you better already know how to build one of these!)
- Refined the top edge to be staggered with the keys, a la [Ben Vallack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqpBKuEVinw)
- Adjusted the position of the power switch and reset button
- Removed tenting puck and holes unnecessary for Kailh choc v1 switches

The [`half-swept_gerber.zip`](https://github.com/sartak/Sweep/raw/main/Sweep%20half-swept/half-swept_gerber.zip) has been updated, ready to be sent to a PCB manufacturer.
